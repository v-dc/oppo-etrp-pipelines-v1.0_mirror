## 2025-01-15 - Framework: Initial Setup

### Added
- `meta/framework_evolution_guide.md` - Instructions for Claude Code to evolve framework
- `meta/context_file_standards.md` - Standards for consistent documentation
- `meta/discovery_templates/` - Templates for documenting discoveries
- `meta/framework_changelog.md` - This changelog file

### Established
- Framework governance structure
- Documentation standards
- Discovery documentation process
- Self-improvement capability for Claude Code

### Framework Principles
- Every module should improve the framework
- Document discoveries immediately, not later
- Use templates for consistency
- Make knowledge reusable across modules

## Template Entry for Claude Code

When you make framework changes, add an entry like this:

```markdown
## {YYYY-MM-DD} - Module: {module_name}

### Added
- `context/technology/{new_file}.md` - Discovered {technology} {version} syntax changes
- `patterns/{new_pattern}.py` - Created reusable pattern for {purpose}

### Updated
- `context/system_context.yaml` - Added new database tables: {table_names}
- `progress/module_status.yaml` - Marked {module_name} as completed
- `patterns/{existing_pattern}.py` - Enhanced error handling based on module experience

### Discovered
- {Technology insight 1}: Brief description of what was learned
- {Process improvement}: How development workflow was enhanced
- {Integration pattern}: New way to connect technologies effectively

### Notes
- {Implementation insight}: What worked well or challenges encountered
- {Performance finding}: Any performance-related discoveries
- {Future consideration}: Ideas for future framework improvements
```

## Framework Evolution Goals

### Short Term (Next 3 Modules)
- [ ] Establish consistent technology documentation patterns
- [ ] Build library of reusable code patterns
- [ ] Validate discovery template effectiveness
- [ ] Refine human-AI collaboration workflow

### Medium Term (Project Completion)
- [ ] Complete technology guide coverage for all tools used
- [ ] Comprehensive pattern library for data engineering tasks
- [ ] Validated standards for enterprise AI-assisted development
- [ ] Documented best practices for framework governance

### Long Term (Framework Reuse)
- [ ] Framework template for other projects
- [ ] Metrics for measuring framework effectiveness
- [ ] Automated quality checks for framework compliance
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD for framework validation

## Framework Health Metrics

Track these metrics to measure framework improvement:

### Development Velocity
- Time to complete similar modules (should decrease)
- Lines of boilerplate code needed (should decrease)
- Number of repeated mistakes (should decrease)

### Knowledge Capture
- Number of technology guides created
- Number of reusable patterns identified
- Coverage of common mistakes documented

### Quality Consistency
- Adherence to naming conventions
- Completeness of documentation
- Working status of all code examples

## Framework Governance

### Review Process
1. **After each module**: Review framework additions for quality
2. **Weekly**: Check framework health metrics
3. **Monthly**: Evaluate framework evolution against goals

### Quality Standards
- All technology guides must include working examples
- All patterns must be tested in actual development
- All mistakes must include prevention strategies
- All discoveries must be immediately actionable

### Maintenance Responsibilities
- **Claude Code**: Creates and maintains technical content
- **Human Developer**: Reviews and validates framework evolution
- **Framework**: Self-improves through documented discovery process
