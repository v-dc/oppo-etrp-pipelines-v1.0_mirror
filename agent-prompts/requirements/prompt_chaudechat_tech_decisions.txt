Architectural Decision Analysis Prompt for CTOS eTR+ Phase 2 Design
TASK

Analyze the Phase 1 requirements documents and AWS context materials to identify and document critical architectural decisions for the CTOS eTR+ platform rebuild. Create a concise architectural decisions document that ranks decisions by importance and provides clear recommendations with rationale.
DELIVERABLES

Create requirements/architectural_decisions.md containing:

    Decision Ranking: Major technology choices ranked by importance/impact
    Decision Summary: For each decision - options, recommendation, rationale
    Key Trade-offs: Critical benefits/limitations of recommended choices
    Implementation Impact: Cost and timeline implications

SUCCESS CRITERIA

    All major technology decisions identified and ranked by importance
    Clear recommendation with concise rationale for each decision
    Trade-offs explicitly stated for critical decisions
    Cost implications noted where significant
    Document is concise and actionable for decision makers

CONTEXT FILES

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

Identify and rank decisions by impact on:

    Meeting 5x volume growth requirements
    CCA 2025 compliance timeline
    Cost optimization
    Operational complexity

CONSTRAINTS & STANDARDS

Keep recommendations focused on:

    Malaysia region service availability and compliance
    Zero data loss tolerance during migration
    Team skillset and learning curve considerations
    Budget optimization for long-term operations

OUTPUT FORMAT

Structure requirements/architectural_decisions.md as a concise decision summary:

    Rank decisions 1-6 by importance
    For each decision: Options → Recommendation → Rationale → Trade-offs
    Keep total document under 2000 words
    Focus on actionable information for decision makers
