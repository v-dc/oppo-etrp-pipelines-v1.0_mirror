# Credit Bureau Data Platform Template - Business Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
Create a production-ready credit bureau data platform template that can be rapidly deployed for client solutions, reducing time-to-market and providing a standardized foundation for credit data processing.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goal
Build a reusable credit bureau template emulating real credit bureau functionality to accelerate client solution delivery.

### Success Criteria
- **Time-to-Market**: Reduce client implementation time from months to weeks
- **Standardization**: Consistent data processing patterns across all client deployments
- **Scalability**: Template works from prototype (single server) to production (AWS multi-node)
- **Data Quality**: Reliable processing of credit data with comprehensive validation

## Stakeholders

### Internal Team
- **Development Team**: Template creators and maintainers
- **Sales/Client Delivery**: Template users for client projects
- **Technical Architects**: Scalability and pattern governance

### External (Future Clients)
- **Credit Bureaus**: Primary target customers
- **Financial Institutions**: Secondary market for credit data solutions
- **Fintech Companies**: Emerging market requiring credit data processing

## Business Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Historical Data Processing**: Load 19,976 historical files (1999-2024)
2. **Ongoing Data Ingestion**: Process ~50 monthly files from subscribers
3. **Dual Storage Strategy**: Populate both Iceberg lakehouse and operational Postgres
4. **Credit Data Validation**: Implement credit bureau-specific quality rules
5. **Template Portability**: Easy deployment across different environments

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Process monthly data within daily SLA
2. **Reliability**: 99% successful processing rate
3. **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and standard patterns
4. **Portability**: Single-server to cloud deployment compatibility

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Assets
- 19,976 historical credit data files (1999-2024)
- Raw text file format from credit data subscribers
- Team experience from previous client credit bureau projects
- NPD server infrastructure ready for development

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- **No Standardized Template**: Each client project starts from scratch
- **Long Implementation Cycles**: Custom development for each client
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different approaches across projects
- **Limited Reusability**: Solutions not designed for template usage

## Business Value Proposition

### For Internal Organization
- **Faster Delivery**: Template reduces implementation time by 70%
- **Higher Margins**: Less custom development per client
- **Competitive Advantage**: Faster response to RFPs and client needs
- **Quality Consistency**: Proven patterns reduce project risk

### For Clients
- **Proven Solution**: Battle-tested credit bureau functionality
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Accelerated go-live timelines
- **Lower Risk**: Pre-validated data processing patterns
- **Scalability Path**: Clear evolution from prototype to production

## Project Scope

### In Scope - Week 1
- Historical data ingestion pipeline (19,976 files)
- Monthly data processing workflow (~50 files)
- Basic credit data validation rules
- Iceberg lakehouse population
- Operational Postgres database
- Template documentation and deployment guide

### Future Scope
- Advanced credit scoring algorithms
- Real-time data processing capabilities
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Cloud deployment automation (AWS)
- Multi-tenant architecture patterns

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Server Limitations**: Single server may constrain processing speed
- **Data Quality**: Unknown issues in historical files
- **Integration Complexity**: Iceberg + Postgres dual-write challenges

### Business Risks
- **Template Adoption**: Internal team may resist standardized approach
- **Client Customization**: Clients may require extensive modifications
- **Competitive Response**: Competitors may develop similar templates

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with robust single-server solution, design for horizontal scaling
- Implement comprehensive data profiling before processing
- Design modular architecture to support client customizations

## Timeline and Milestones

### Week 1 (Current Sprint)
- **Day 1-2**: Complete Phase 1 (Requirements & Design)
- **Day 3-4**: Historical data profiling and ingestion pipeline
- **Day 5-6**: Monthly processing workflow and validation
- **Day 7**: Integration testing and documentation

### Future Iterations
- **Week 2**: Performance optimization and error handling
- **Week 3**: Advanced validation rules and monitoring
- **Week 4**: Template packaging and deployment automation

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions
- Historical files follow consistent format (to be validated)
- Monthly file volumes remain stable (~50 files)
- Single-server solution provides adequate prototype performance
- Team Python/SQL skills sufficient for Spark/Airflow learning curve

### Dependencies
- NPD server availability and performance
- Access to historical credit data files
- Claude Code availability for development acceleration
- Stakeholder availability for requirements validation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Minimum Viable Template
- [ ] Successfully process all 19,976 historical files
- [ ] Handle monthly ingestion of 50 new files
- [ ] Populate Iceberg lakehouse with partitioned data
- [ ] Maintain operational Postgres for real-time queries
- [ ] Implement basic credit data validation rules
- [ ] Document deployment and operation procedures

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Zero data loss during historical processing
- [ ] < 1% data quality rule violations
- [ ] Template deployable on fresh server in < 4 hours
- [ ] All code follows established patterns and standards
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality

## Business Glossary

- **Credit Bureau**: Organization that collects and maintains credit information
- **Subscriber**: Financial institution providing credit data to bureau
- **Template**: Reusable solution pattern for rapid client deployment
- **Lakehouse**: Combined data lake and warehouse architecture (Iceberg)
- **Operational Database**: Real-time query system (Postgres)
