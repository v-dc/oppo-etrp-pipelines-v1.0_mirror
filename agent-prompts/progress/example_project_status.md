# Project Status - CB-Core

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-26

## Completed ✅
- Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements
- Phase 2: Architecture & Design  
- Phase 3: Development Environment Setup
- **Historical File Discovery Pipeline** (2025-06-26)
  - Discovery module with filename pattern parsing
  - Iceberg metadata table integration
  - Airflow DAG with virtual environment isolation
  - Unit tests and validation notebook
  - Successfully processes 19,975+ historical files

## In Progress 🔄
- Historical data processing optimization
- Live file processing module development

## Next Up ⏳
- Live file processing module
- Data quality framework integration
- Historical data transformation pipeline

## Recent Learnings 💡
- Manual configuration safer than automated system changes
- Airflow 3.0 requires specific syntax context for Claude Code
- Exclusive processing works better than concurrent on single server
- Staging-first approach provides necessary data quality control
- **BashOperator more reliable than SparkSubmitOperator for virtual environments**
- **Explicit DataFrame schemas prevent Spark type inference issues**
- **Filename pattern analysis critical before implementation**
- **Virtual environment isolation essential for Airflow + Spark integration**

## Blockers 🚧
- None (discovery pipeline operational)

## Key Metrics 📊
- Historical files to process: 19,975 (discovered)
- Discovery pipeline runtime: ~35 minutes for full dataset
- Data quality target: > 99% clean records
- **Discovery Success Rate**: 100% (all files parsed and cataloged)

## Team Notes 📝
- Using Claude Code for accelerated development
- All modules follow agent-prompts task structure
- Focus on template reusability for client deployments
- Manual system configuration approach adopted
- **Discovery pipeline template ready for client deployments**

## Current Architecture Status 🏗️
- **Discovery Layer**: ✅ Operational (Iceberg catalog populated)
- **Ingestion Layer**: ⏳ Next phase
- **Transformation Layer**: ⏳ Pending
- **Quality Layer**: ⏳ Framework ready for integration
