## Data Discovery Phase üîÑ (2025-07-07)

### Completed Today ‚úÖ
- **Data Dictionary Analysis & Enhancement**
  - Analyzed original dictionary.xlsx from requirements material
  - Identified and resolved missing field definitions
  - Created draft_dictionary.xlsx with 40 complete field definitions
  - Validated field formats and data types for all columns

- **Sample Data Generation**
  - Created realistic sample data generator script
  - Generated 3 provider-specific sample files (1000 rows each):
    - jcl_202412_20250104_0925.txt (Trade facilities focus)
    - boost_202411_20241229_1715.txt (Personal financing focus)  
    - chinchin_202412_20250117_1407.txt (Equipment/vehicle financing)
  - Implemented Malaysian-specific data patterns (IC numbers, mobile formats, company registration)

- **PySpark Schema Definition**
  - Created comprehensive schema YAML file (draft_schema_raw.yaml)
  - Defined all 40 fields with proper data types
  - Included validation rules and format specifications
  - Created test script to validate schema with sample data

- **Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook**
  - Created load_sample_files.ipynb for comprehensive data analysis
  - Implemented automatic categorical/numerical variable detection
  - Generated frequency plots for categorical variables (‚â§30 categories)
  - Created histograms and box plots for all numerical variables
  - Added correlation heatmap and data quality checks
  - Fixed Decimal type compatibility issues with matplotlib

- **Documentation & Organization**
  - Created README_analysis.md documenting all analysis scripts
  - Updated .gitignore with comprehensive Python/Spark/data patterns
  - Organized scripts in scripts/analysis/ directory
  - Set up proper virtual environment with required dependencies

### Key Technical Decisions üí°
- Used pipe-delimited format for data files
- Maintained date fields as strings (yyyyMMdd format) for flexibility
- Decimal(18,2) for all monetary fields
- Integer types for status codes and enumerations

### Tools & Dependencies üì¶
- Python 3.12 with virtual environment
- PySpark 3.5.3 (downgraded from 4.0 for stability)
- pandas, openpyxl for Excel processing
- Faker for realistic data generation
- PyYAML for schema configuration
- Jupyter, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for data visualization

## Next Up ‚è≥
- 

## Notes üìù
- Sample data includes realistic Malaysian demographics and business patterns
- Schema supports both mandatory and optional fields per business rules
