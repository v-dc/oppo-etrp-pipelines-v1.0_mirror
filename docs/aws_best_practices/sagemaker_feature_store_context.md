## Architecture Patterns

### **Dual Storage Strategy**
```
Feature Ingestion
├── Online Store (DynamoDB-backed)
│   ├── Latest values only
│   ├── Real-time lookup via GetRecord API
│   └── Sub-10ms latency
└── Offline Store (S3-backed)
    ├── Historical data retention
    ├── Athena/EMR query access
    └── Batch processing support
```

```

**With Lambda:**
```python
# Real-time feature updates
response = featurestore_runtime.put_record(
    FeatureGroupName='customer_features',
    Record=[{'FeatureName': 'name', 'ValueAsString': 'value'}]
)
```

### **Query Integration**

**SQL Access via Athena:**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, credit_score, debt_ratio
FROM feature_store_database.customer_features
WHERE event_time >= '2025-01-01'
```

**Real-time Access:**
```python
# Get latest features for customer
response = featurestore_runtime.get_record(
    FeatureGroupName='customer_features',
    RecordIdentifierValueAsString='customer_123'
)
```
