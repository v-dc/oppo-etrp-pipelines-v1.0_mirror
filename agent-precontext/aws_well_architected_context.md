- [Framework Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-pillars-of-the-framework.html)

## Purpose
This file extracts essential principles, practices, and decision guides from the AWS Well-Architected Framework to be applied during the design of the eTR+ pipeline and any related AWS architecture.

**Latest Update:** November 2024 (100% of best practices refreshed)

## Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework

### 1. **Operational Excellence**
> Focus: Run and monitor systems, continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

- Perform operations as code (IaC) - CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine procedures through lessons learned
- Anticipate failure and design for it
- Standardize responses to events and automate recovery
- **Data Focus**: Automate pipeline deployments, implement comprehensive monitoring (CloudWatch), create runbooks for data quality issues

#### Key Design Questions:
- How do you determine what operations are necessary?
- How do you evolve operations procedures over time?

---

### 2. **Security**
> Focus: Protect data, systems, and assets. Leverage cloud-native security controls.

- Implement strong identity foundations (least privilege, role-based access)
- Enable traceability (CloudTrail, GuardDuty)
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices (KMS, S3 policies, parameter store)
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Prepare for security events (incident response runbooks)
- **Data Focus**: Encrypt data at rest (S3, RDS) and in transit, implement fine-grained access controls, maintain data lineage and audit trails

#### Key Design Questions:
- How do you control access?
- How do you protect data?

---

### 3. **Reliability**
> Focus: Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions.

- Automatically recover from failure (auto-scaling, self-healing)
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
- Stop guessing capacity (use managed services)
- Manage change through automation
- **Data Focus**: Multi-AZ deployments, automated backup/recovery, circuit breakers, cross-region replication for critical data

#### Key Design Questions:
- How do you design for fault tolerance?
- How do you back up and restore critical data?

---

### 4. **Performance Efficiency**
> Focus: Use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements.

- Democratize advanced technologies (managed ML, analytics, etc.)
- Go global in minutes (CDNs, AWS Regions)
- Use serverless architectures where possible (Lambda, MWAA, Glue)
- Experiment more often
- Use performance monitoring tools (CloudWatch, X-Ray)
- **Data Focus**: Right-size compute resources (EMR, Glue DPUs), optimize data formats (Parquet, Iceberg), implement caching strategies

#### Key Design Questions:
- How do you select compute/storage solutions?
- How do you monitor and improve performance?

---

### 5. **Cost Optimization**
> Focus: Avoid unnecessary costs and understand cloud economics.

- Implement cloud financial management (FinOps)
- Adopt a consumption model (spot instances, auto-scaling)
- Measure overall efficiency (e.g., DPU usage in Glue)
- Analyze and attribute expenditure
- Use managed services to reduce overhead
- **Data Focus**: Spot instances for batch processing, S3 storage class optimization, data lifecycle management, cost allocation tags

#### Key Design Questions:
- How do you ensure cost-effective resources?
- How do you monitor and track spending?

---

### 6. **Sustainability** (added December 2021)
> Focus: Minimize environmental impact of cloud workloads.

- Understand impact and goals (carbon intensity metrics)
- Maximize utilization (consolidate workloads)
- Use managed services for energy efficiency
- Use Region-specific sustainability data
- **Data Focus**: Choose regions with renewable energy, implement data compression, automate resource scaling/shutdown

#### Key Design Questions:
- How do you design for sustainability?
- How do you measure improvement?

## Common Design Trade-offs
- **Reliability vs Cost**: Balancing resilience with resource expenses
- **Performance vs Efficiency**: Speed vs resource optimization
- **Security vs Usability**: Protection vs user experience
- **Automation vs Control**: Managed services vs custom control
- **Consistency vs Availability**: CAP theorem in distributed systems

## Data Pipeline Specific Considerations
- **Data Governance**: Implement cataloging, lineage, quality monitoring
- **Scalability**: Design for elastic compute/storage, data partitioning
- **Compliance**: Encrypt data, fine-grained access, audit trails
- **Operations**: Automate deployments, comprehensive monitoring, recovery plans

## Implementation Recommendations for eTR+
- Use IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation) for repeatable environments
- Automate ingestion, validation, and publishing steps
- Monitor data quality, cost, and task duration actively
- Apply IAM policies per pipeline and per environment (dev/UAT/prod)
- Use managed services (MWAA, RDS, Glue) to reduce ops burden
- Conduct Well-Architected reviews every 3-6 months

## Key Tools
- **AWS Well-Architected Tool**: Free workload assessments and improvement tracking
- **Well-Architected Lenses**: Industry-specific guidance (Data Analytics, Serverless, ML)
- **Well-Architected Labs**: Hands-on implementation guides

> Apply the Well-Architected Lens Review periodically during the project lifecycle.
